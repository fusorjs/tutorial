Fusor DOM recipes.

**[Demo Website](https://fusorjs.github.io/dom-recipes/)**

[Fusor DOM library](https://github.com/fusorjs/dom#readme)

## Setup

Initialize and configure your application in the entry file.

See: [index.ts](src/index.ts).

## Routing

> In my opinion, routing does not need any abstraction. It will make things more complicated.

- Automatic nested routing: [App.ts](src/component/App.ts)
- More routing examples: [Routing.ts](src/component/Routing.ts)

## Todo

- different dynamic array children strategies
- css usage
- http request with unmount
- interval counter with unmount
- nested routing

## Done

- counter button with dynamic counter: [ClickCounter.ts](src/component/ClickCounter.ts)
